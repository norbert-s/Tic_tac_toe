# Tic_tac_toe

As part of the freecodecamp front end development challenges, you need to -along the line of finishing the legacy coding front end challenges-
develop a tic-tac-toe program.

it is a simple implementeation -althugh open for extention- of tic-tac-toe with random game play.
Later on I implemented minimax algorithm in a tic-tac-toe game with C++, also with alpha-beta pruning, also a game play of computer vs computer using the very same algorithm
But here it was important due to the challange to put together a working version of the game , with the UI working properly etc.
It was written in Js

Currently it works only in Chrome.
